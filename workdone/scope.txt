Okay guys we have our first campaign, this one isn't so much of a RT campaign as it is a pentest.
So our scope is this api, our client wants to know if his api is vulnerable to any exploitation that
may lead to RCE (Remote Command Execution). So our goal is to set up a server running "couchdb" which would 
recieve data from the api regarding where a user browsing, how long they were there, how many tabs they have open
etc. With that we're trying to force the api to send malicous code to the server which would then process the code 
to send a remote shell back to our attacker ip's. If you need any more details LMK.
